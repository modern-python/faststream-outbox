# Opt-in DLQ on terminal failure — implementation detail

User-facing: `docs/usage/dlq.md`. Invariant summary: `CLAUDE.md` § Opt-in DLQ.

## Default and opt-in

`make_dlq_table(metadata, table_name="outbox_dlq")` returns a sibling audit table; pass it to `OutboxBroker(..., dlq_table=...)` to archive terminal failures. **Default broker behavior is unchanged when `dlq_table` is None — every existing code path is bit-for-bit identical.**

## Atomicity via single CTE

`OutboxClient.delete_with_lease` switches to `WITH deleted AS (DELETE … RETURNING …) INSERT INTO <dlq> SELECT … FROM deleted` when configured. One statement preserves the writer-connection autocommit fast path and the lease-token guard; INSERT failure rolls back the DELETE, so the outbox row stays leased and is reclaimed when the lease expires — **DLQ misconfiguration surfaces as outbox-table growth + `lease_lost` spikes rather than silent audit loss.** Identifiers are quoted via the dialect's `identifier_preparer`; values flow through bind params.

The CTE's `RETURNING` / `INSERT` / `SELECT` column lists are not hand-written — they derive from `_DLQ_PROJECTION` (the `(outbox_col, dlq_col)` pairs copied verbatim) plus `_DLQ_INJECTED_COLUMNS` (`failure_reason`, `last_exception`, supplied by the caller) in `schema.py`. The fake (`FakeOutboxClient.delete_with_lease`) builds its audit dict from the same constants, so the two substrates can't drift on which columns the archive carries — a DLQ column change is one edit in `schema.py`, verified across both adapters by `tests/test_client_contract.py`. `failed_at` is not in the projection; it rides the DLQ column's `server_default`.

## Terminal-outcome routing

`OutboxInnerMessage.outcome` records a single canonical `Outcome` (`message.py`): `Ack` (success), `Retry(delay_seconds)`, or `Terminal(reason)`. The three failure paths record a `Terminal`:

- `allow_delivery` False → `Terminal("max_deliveries")`
- `_nack` strategy-exhausted → `Terminal("retry_terminal")`
- `_reject` → `Terminal("rejected")`

`terminal_failure_reason` is now a **read-only view** of `outcome` (`Terminal.reason`, else `None`), so existing readers are unchanged: `_flush_terminal` reads it to decide whether to build a DLQ payload; the `nacked_terminal(reason=…)` tag value comes from the same reason. `dispatch_one` **matches on the disjoint `Outcome` variant** — `Terminal → nacked_terminal`, `Retry → reschedule`, `Ack → delete`. Because the variants are mutually exclusive there is no ordering dependence between the arms: a manual `await msg.reject()` (no exception raised) records `Terminal("rejected")` directly, independent of `last_exception`. Success (`_ack` → `Ack`) leaves `terminal_failure_reason` None; success rows never touch the DLQ.

**The `DLQFailureReason` `Literal` type (`message.py`) is the public contract** for this string — operator queries and dashboard labels key off these values, so changing them is API-breaking.

## `last_exception` bounds

`last_exception` is rendered by `_render_last_exception` (`subscriber/usecase.py`) and bounded by `_LAST_EXCEPTION_MAX_CHARS=8192`. The default render is `repr(exc)`; some exceptions carry MB-scale payloads (validation errors with the full request body, `asyncpg.DataError` with the rejected row), so an unbounded `repr` would extend the writer round-trip on a poison row and bloat the DLQ — truncation appends `…[truncated]`. Because that `repr` can embed payloads / PII / credentials, `OutboxBroker(..., last_exception_renderer=...)` (a `Callable[[BaseException], str | None]`, read from `OutboxBrokerConfig.last_exception_renderer`) lets a deployment redact (`type(exc).__name__`) or drop it (`None`); a custom renderer's output is still length-capped. The DLQ `failure_reason` column is `String(64)` (current literals fit in 14 bytes; the breathing room lets the canonical set grow without a column-widening migration).

## Retention

There is no built-in retention/pruning. Operators are responsible for archival — suggested pattern: partition the DLQ by `failed_at` and drop old partitions via a cron job.

## `validate_schema()` mechanics

`validate_schema()` delegates to `alembic.autogenerate.compare_metadata` against a throwaway `MetaData` populated by `make_outbox_table(...)` — so the canonical `Table` is the single source of truth and the validator never duplicates the schema declaration. It only flags **missing** schema (`add_*` / `modify_*` ops); `remove_*` ops are intentionally ignored so users may attach extras (audit columns, their own indexes). Alembic is an **optional dependency** (`faststream-outbox[validate]`); without it, `validate_schema()` raises `ImportError`, but every other code path works (the import lives at the top of `client.py` inside a try/except, with module-level sentinels `_alembic_compare_metadata` / `_AlembicMigrationContext` set to `None` on failure).

Alembic's diff is **blind to three things the producer's `ON CONFLICT` arbiter and the lease invariant depend on**, so `validate_schema()` runs extra `pg_catalog` probes alongside it: the partial-index **WHERE predicates** (alembic ignores `postgresql_where`), the **uniqueness** of `timer_id_uq` (`pg_index.indisunique` — a same-named non-unique index passes the predicate check yet breaks `ON CONFLICT` at publish time), and the **`<table>_lease_ck` CHECK** definition (alembic has no check-constraint comparator). Each surfaces a drifted/non-partial/non-unique index or a missing/altered CHECK that the diff alone would miss.

The CHECK probe matches by **predicate, not name**. The live constraint name is not predictable from the package side: a `MetaData` carrying a SQLAlchemy `ck` `naming_convention` re-templates the explicitly-named `CheckConstraint` (the name fills the `%(constraint_name)s` token, so the in-memory `.name` becomes e.g. `ck_<table>_<table>_lease_ck`), **but** a hand-written migration — `op.create_check_constraint('<table>_lease_ck', ...)` — creates the literal name verbatim, because Alembic op functions don't apply `target_metadata`'s convention. So the live name varies by how the migration was authored; only the predicate is stable. `_validate_check_constraints_sync` therefore normalizes every live CHECK's predicate and passes if one matches `(acquired_token IS NULL) = (acquired_at IS NULL)` under **any** name; absent (including a drifted predicate — that's just "the right one is missing"), it reports `missing CHECK constraint enforcing '<predicate>'`. An earlier name-prediction approach (reading the convention-resolved `.name` off the `Table`) was reverted in #103: it demanded the doubled name that autogenerate-style creation produces and so falsely failed the literal name a hand-written migration creates. The explicitly-named indexes are unaffected — the `ix`/`uq` convention keys only re-template auto-named indexes, so the index probes still match by literal name.
